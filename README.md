**Flexbox**<br>
Create an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project. <br>
This challenge is meant to implement what was taught throughout the flexbox course and exercises.<br>
Hence, the landing page is **not responsive or mobile friendly**. <br> 
The purpose of this landing page project is to practice the Flexbox layout model.

**Flexbox**
Create an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 8px; justify-content: center;">
<img src="./design/01.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
<img src="./design/02.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px;">
Design | Details
</div>

<br>
The image placeholders can be filled by photos chosen by me.<br>
This challenge is meant to implement what was taught throughout the flexbox course and exercises.

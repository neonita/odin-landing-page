**Flexbox**<br>
Create an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project:

<div align="center">
<img src="./design/01.png" width="50%">
<img src="./design/02.png" width="49%">
<small>Design â€” Details</small>
</div>
<br>

<br>
The image placeholders can be filled by photos chosen by me.<br>
This challenge is meant to implement what was taught throughout the flexbox course and exercises.
